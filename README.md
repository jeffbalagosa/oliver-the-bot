# Project: Oliver The Bot (A ChatGPT Clone)

## Description:

I developed a clone of ChatGPT using React, Express, Cors, and Body Parser. The popularity of the original ChatGPT often results in server downtime. To overcome this, I leveraged GPT-3's API to build a similar website. I added an extra feature allowing users to choose their preferred model based on factors like cost and coding ability. By accessing the API as a paying customer, I was able to eliminate downtime issues.
